CS121: Schelling model of housing segregation

Schelling.java: Skeleton for your solution.  This file is the only one
  you will modify

The following files must not be modified:
  Homeowner.java: enumerate type for representing the state of
    homeowners.

  Location.java: object type for representing locations (i,j).
  
  SampleLocationUses.java: example uses of the Location type

  TestIsSatisfied.java: test framework for testing Schelling.isSatistifed.
    See tests/isSatisfied.txt for the test descriptions.

  TestDoSimulation.java: test framework for testing
    Schelling.doSimulation.  See tests/doSimulation.txt for the test
    descriptions.

  BasicTest.java: some very simple code that may be helpful for
    putting together tests for your functions.

  DrawGrid.java: a simple program that takes the name of a grid file
    and draws a representation of the grid.  This version does NOT
    identify unsatisfied homeowners.

  DrawGridWithSat.java: a simple program that takes the name of a grid
    file and draws a representation of the grid.  This version
    identifies unsatisfied homeowners using Schelling.isSatisfied.
    You can only use this version of DrawGrid if you have implemented
    an isSatisfied function in Schelling.java that matches the
    signature in the assignment description.

  Utility.java: a class with functions for reading grids, creating
    grids, drawing grids, etc.  You must not modify this file.
